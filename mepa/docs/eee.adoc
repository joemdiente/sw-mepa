== Energy Efficient Ethernet

The energy efficient ethernet (EEE) helps in reducing the power consumption on physical layer devices. Configuring
these EEE on interfaces includes enabling EEE on Base-T copper ethernet port based on the power utilization and
also verifying if EEE is saving energy on the configured ports.


The API `mepa_eee_mode_conf_set()` is used to Set EEE Configuration.
The structure mepa_phy_eee_conf_t has two paramters `eee_mode` and `eee_ena_phy`
`eee_mode` denotes the New EEE State
`eee_ena_phy` denotes the Current EEE State

To Enable EEE Mode::
'eee_mode' - `MEPA_EEE_ENABLE`
'eee_ena_phy' - FALSE

To Disable EEE Mode::
`eee_mode` - `MEPA_EEE_DISABLE`
`eee_ena_phy` - TRUE

Register Update without changing state in EEE::
`eee_mode` - TRUE  - Performs Register update for EEE_ENABLE mode
`eee_ena_phy` - FALSE - Performs Register update for EEE_DISABLE mode

The API `mepa_eee_mode_conf_get()` is used to get the current EEE configuration with the values `eee_mode` and `eee_ena_phy`

The API `mepa_eee_status_get()` is used to return the status of EEE which includes 
advertisement capability of EEE Link Partner, status parameter indicating Rx and Tx LPI recieved

= Loopback demo Application

== Loopback Description
Loopback in Physical Layer (PHY) devices is a diagnostic feature used to test and verify the functionality
 of network hardware. It involves routing the transmitted signal back to the receiver within the same device,
 allowing for the testing of the transmission and reception paths without the need for external connections

Loopback testing is crucial for diagnosing and troubleshooting network issues, verifying hardware functionality,
and ensuring the integrity of data transmission.

== Directory
* `./mepa_demo/mepa_apps/phy_loopback.c` - Source Code for Loopback Demo Sample Application.
* `./mepa_demo/mepa_scripts/loopback_config.json` - JSON file for Loopback config, Application will take configuration from this File

== Prerequisites
To Test Loopback Demo Application User have to use `arm64_vsc7558TSN.ext4` image to EDSx Platform.

== Procedure to run Loopback Demo Application

To Run Loopback Demo Application the 'mepa-demo' application needs to be running.
Refer Section link:#mepa_demo/docs/getting-started[Getting-Started] to
know about the procedure to run 'mepa-demo' Application.

Once 'mepa-demo' application is started then we can run the Loopback Demo Application
with help of following Command.

    mepa-cmd loopback <port_no> -f <file_name>

The configuration is transmitted to the designated port from the JSON file specified by filename.
This file contains the structures `mepa_loopback_t` and `vtss_phy_10g_loopback_t` in JSON format.
The JSON string must begin with the JSON object "1gconfig" for 1G PHY's and "10g_config" for VSC8258 PHY.

User must enable any one of the loopback configuration for the respective PHY.

To List the all available arguments in the Loopback Demo Application run the below mentioned command.

----
# mepa-cmd loopback ?

Description:
------------
Configure loopback for particular port number.

Syntax:
-------
loopback <port_no> [-f] [filename]

Parameters:
-----------
<port_no>: Port number or zero
file             :  file option

filename       :  filename)

== Host/Line side Loopbacks

 * Host side loopbacks (H1/H2/H4 etc) can be verified by transmitting packets from Line side
of the PHY to Link partner using packet tx command.

 * Lineside loopback (L1/L2/L3 etc) can be verified by transmitting packets from Link partner side to the DUT PHY
using packet tx command.

 * Whether the transmitted packets got received back can be verified by using port statistics command.

Below is the example of loopback demo application running on EDSx Switch with VSC8258 PHY.

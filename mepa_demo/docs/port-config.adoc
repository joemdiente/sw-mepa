== Introduction.

To facilitate data traffic through the PHY, it is necessary to implement configurations on both the line
and host sides of the PHY interface.

The host aspect of the PHY supports a variety of interfaces, including but not 
limited to QSGMII, SGMII, RGMII, QXGMII, SXGMII, XGMII, XAUI, and SFI, as well as line-side interfaces 
that accommodate copper and fiber media, inclusive of automotive standards.

For the integration of Host/MAC interfaces, the available interface within the MEPA framework is 
designated as `mesa_port_interface_t`, while the interface for Line/MEDIA connections is referred 
to as `mesa_phy_media_interface_t`.

The MAC/Host side of the PHY must be connected to a compatible MAC that supports the corresponding interface.
For example, a MAC with QSGMII interface capabilities can be linked to a compatible PHY. Given that a PHY may
offer support for various interfaces, it is imperative to select and configure the correct electrical interface to
ensure effective communication between the PHY, the MAC, and the link partner.

Once the electrical interface is correctly configured, it is necessary to set up auto or manual negotiation 
parameters, as outlined in clauses 28 and 37, to enable the PHY to establish a connection with the link partner 
or MAC. The negotiation process is contingent upon the capabilities of the link partner or MAC, which will 
determine the link status, speed, and duplex mode. Upon successful negotiation, the PHY is prepared to 
communicate with its counterpart.

PHY can be held in COMA MODE by setting active high on GPIO pins (EDSX-GPIO33, EDS2-GPIO63(slot1),64(slot2)) and can be released
by asserting pin low.

Steps involved in the port-config aplication are:

	1. Creating the Dev `mepa_drv_create` 
	2. Attaching the Dev `cli_cmd_dev_attach`
	3. Configuring the Dev `cli_cmd_phy_conf`
	4. Deleting the Dev    `mepa_drv_del`


The Port-Config application facilitates the utilization of MEPA, providing a foundational understanding 
of PHY configuration. This application allows for the implementation of the above mentioned configurations. 
Below is a detailed guide on how to use the Port-Config application effectively.


== Creating the Dev.

 mepa-cmd dev create <port_no>

Dev is a software instance of a port in the PHY, if the PHY is Quad channel PHY there will be
4 instances.

This command will identify the phy which is connected in the port number and create a MEPA DEV 
instance for the PHY.

The creation of MEPA instances must be initiated by the application. A MEPA instance is established
through the invocation of the `mepa_create()` function. Upon successful execution, this function returns 
a pointer to `mepa_device_t`. The `mepa_device_t` serves as a representation of an individual PHY and is 
essential for the operation of all subsequent MEPA API calls pertaining to that specific PHY.

The necessary params needed for creating this Dev is 

	1. `mepa_callout`
	2. `mepa_callout_ctx`
	3. `mepa_board_conf_t`

=== callout & callout_ctx

In order for MEPA to be able to configure/query a given PHY, it needs to access
the registers inside the PHY. To access PHY registers, some kind of
bus-controller is needed (example MIIM), and if it is a shared bus, some
addresses are needed. To keep MEPA board and OS agnostic, a set of call-back
functions facilitating register access must be provided when creating a MEPA
instance (see `struct mepa_callout`). A given board may have multiple buses,
multiple PHYs, which lead to board specific needs for addressing a given PHYs.
To avoid board dependencies in MEPA, all the callback functions therefore have a
`struct mepa_callout_cxt`, defined and provided by the application itself, and
only used by the application when the callback functions are used. Both the
`mepa_callout_t` and `mepa_callout_ctx` object pointers are considered shared
pointers, meaning that the memory pointing to must remain valid during the
entire life time of the `mepa_device_t` instance.

refer `mepa_drv_create`
 
=== mepa_board_conf_t

In board_config we pass port_no in board_conf.numeric_handle

NOTE: if the PHY is vsc PHY the board_conf.vtss_instance_use, board_conf.vtss_instance_ptr 
and board_conf.vtss_instance_create is important, if the vtss_instance_create = 1 , 
MEPA will create a new vtss_instance and give it back in vtss_instance_ptr, if you want to use 
the same vtss_instance_ptr for all the  VSC PHY ports set vtss_instance_use = 1;
if vtss_instance_create = 0, MEPA will attach the all the phy's in the default vtss_instance.


== Attaching the Dev

	mepa-cmd dev attach <port_no> [qsgmii|sfi|sgmii]

This command will attach the phy to the mac with the correct interface. 
eg: The port_no in EDSX correspond to a serdes port for 25G slot1 the application port number is 
13,14,15 and 16 (25G, 10G, 5G SGMII, 2.5G SGMII, 1G SGMII, USXGMII)


== Configuring the dev

	mepa-cmd dev conf <port_no> -f <file_name>

The configuration is passed to the respective port from the file_name, the file consists of 
mepa_conf_t structure in the json format. the json string should start with the json object
"port_config"

 
== Deleting the Dev

	mepa-cmd dev del <port_no>

The Dev instance can be deleted with the above command, when the dev deletion is done 
The dev will be freed and the application deletes the PHY from the respective port no.\

For sample json-file refer to :link:#mepa_demo/mepa_scripts/port_config_json[JSON config]

== Enabling COMA mode

	mepa-cmd coma_mode enable

This command will set the direction of GPIO pin as output and enable COMA mode on the 
PHY by asserting GPIO Pin (GPIO-33 (EDSX), GPIO-64(EDS2)) high.

== Disabling COMA mode

	mepa-cmd coma_mode disable

This command will set the direction of GPIO pin as output and disable COMA mode on the 
PHY by asserting GPIO Pin (GPIO-33 (EDSX), GPIO-64(EDS2)) low.

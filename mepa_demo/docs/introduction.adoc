= Introduction to MEPA-DEMO Application

== Introduction
The Microchip Ethernet PHY API (MEPA) provides a production quality
comprehensive C library supporting all the Ethernet PHYs.

The binary executable in the system which is linking with the MESA library 
and MEPA Library is referred to as the 'mepa-demo' application. An application
is required to instantiate the API, and once instantiated the application
exclusively owns the API and the underlying HW.

This MEPA-DEMO application show how the MEPA APIs can be instantiated
and how to configure different PHYs for various functionalities through MEPA APIs,
using PHY Evaluation Boards. On top of the MEPA APIs, the PHY driver can still have
chip specific APIs that are unique to that PHY, that are accessed directly by the
application mepa-demo application is provided as example code to help getting started.

More about MEPA is available in link:mepa-doc.html#mepa/docs/introduction[MEPA-Intro] section.

The executable binary of this mepa-demo application is combined with the BSP and can
run on the reference systems. More on this in the
link:#mepa_demo/docs/getting-started[Getting Started] section.

== Directory layout
  
* `./mepa_demo/mepa_apps` A demo application for different modules of PHY showing 
 how the MEPA API can be used to configure PHY through MEPA APIs.

* `./mepa_demo/mepa_scripts` - This Directory will have JSON file inputs for few 
  MEPA Sample Applications and it also have Python Scripts of few Sample Applications
  to handle Configurations specific to Particular PHYs.

* `./mepa_demo/examples` - The purpose of these Cook Book examples is to explain how
  specific use-cases can be supported and how to handle it in MEPA/MESA.

== Known Answer Test (KAT) Description
Media Access Control Security(MACsec) is IEEE 802.1AE network security standard which
provides point-to-point security on Ethernet links using GCM-AES algorithm.

KAT (Known Answer Test) is the application which validates the MACsec crypto Engine of PHY.
The Application will configure MACsec Block for Encryption and Decryption with
default MACsec Block Configurations with default MACsec Key and generate the Ethenet frame 
from the Packet genertor block inside PHY and made it to pass through MACsec Block and looping
back the packet after Line Side PCS block.

MACsec block processed (Encrypted/Decrypted) packet is captured in the MACsec FIFO and compared
with the Known Packect(Expected packet) in the Application and application will provide the result
whether the MACsec Engine Test Passed or Failed as a result, if the captured packet and expected 
Encrypted/Decrypted packet is same then KAT Test is Passed othewise test is Failed.

This KAT Demo Application will perform MACsec Crypto Test on all the Ports of HOST (EDSx) where 
MACsec Capable PHYs are connected, if the Host Port has PHY which is not MACsec Capable then KAT
Test will not be performed on that Port.

== Directory
 * `./mepa_demo/mepa_apps/phy_kat_demo.c` - Source Code for KAT Demo Sample Application.

== Prerequisites
To Test KAT Demo Application User have to use either `arm64vsc7888MSEC.itb` or 
`arm64_vsc7558MSEC.ext4` image to EDSx Platform.

== Procedure to run KAT Demo Application

To Run KAT Demo Application the 'mepa-demo' application needs to be running.
Reffer Section link:#mepa_demo/docs/getting-started[Getting-Started] to
know about the procedure to run 'mepa-demo' Application.

Once 'mepa-demo' application is started then we can run the KAT Demo Application
with help of following Command.
    * mepa-cmd kat demo [xpn|non-xpn]

The command 'kat demo' accepts either 'xpn' or 'non-xpn' as the input which 
differentiaties the cipher suit selected by MACsec Engine, where xpn will select
'AES-GCM-XPN-256' cipher suit and non-xpn selects 'AES-GCM-256' cipher suit to
perform MACsec Encryption and Decryption.

Note:: MACsec Block Supports 128-bit Cipher suit and 256-bit Cipher Suit, but KAT 
demo covers only XPN-256 bit and NON-XPN 256 bit Cipher suit. MACsec Operational
Demo Application covers both 128-bit and 256-bit Key reffer link:#mepa_demo/docs/macsec-demo[MACsec-Demo] section. 

Below is the example of KAT demo application running on EDSx Switch with Malibu10G
PHY Connected to EDSx Switch.

----
# mepa-cmd kat demo xpn

 Number of MACsec capable ports detected : 4

PTP sync message 60 Byte Packet is generated on port no : 12
PTP sync message 60 Byte Packet is generated on port no : 13
PTP sync message 60 Byte Packet is generated on port no : 14
PTP sync message 60 Byte Packet is generated on port no : 15

 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! XPN Encryption test passed on all MACsec Capable ports !!!!!!!!!!!!
PTP sync message 60 Byte Packet is generated on port no : 12
PTP sync message 60 Byte Packet is generated on port no : 13
PTP sync message 60 Byte Packet is generated on port no : 14
PTP sync message 60 Byte Packet is generated on port no : 15

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! XPN Decryption test passed on all MACsec Capable ports !!!!!!!!!!!!
----

In above example KAT Demo Application detects 4 MACsec capable Ports in EDSX switch and perform
MACsec Encryption and Decryption Test on those ports and provide result whether 
MACsec Crypto Test Passed or Failed.
